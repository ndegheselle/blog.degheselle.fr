I am a French software developer, interested by a wide variety of technology, libraries, framework ...

Made this here to remember and regroup everything I do !

I also believe that writing this blog will be nice to :
- Exercise my English (excuse my French !)
- Train myself to write documentation that is clear, short and understandable
- Force my code to be concise, short and the as self explanatory as possible
